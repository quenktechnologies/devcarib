A few tips for working on the project.

## Do Not Work On The Master Branch

This branch is reserved for the maintainer of the project. Instead use
`git checkout -b <topic>` to create "feature" or "topic" branches to do
your work.

Once you are done and want to to merge your changes back into the project,
push your topic branch to github and create a pull request.

Remember to delete your topic branch once it has been merged to prevent
future conflicts. Once a topic branch has been merged, you should not
do any additional work on it.
