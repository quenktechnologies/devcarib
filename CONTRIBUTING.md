# Development Workflow

This branch is reserved for the maintainer of the project. Instead use
`git checkout -b <topic>` to create "topic" branches to do
your work.

For example, if you are correcting a spelling error, do 
`git checkout -b fix-spelling-error-in-file` and commit your work there.
Then submit a pull request for review.

Once a topic branch has been merged, you should not continue any additional work 
on it. Delete it and always base your topic branches off the master branch.
